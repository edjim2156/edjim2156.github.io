            <a class="h3-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.apple.com">The apple website</a>
            </h3>

            <p>This is the apple home website. Here is where you will find their latest products like their iphone 16e.</p>
            <p>There are multiple other products on the website being promoted.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Contrast: Elements stand out on the page making everything easy to read and understand.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Repetition: All the elements on the website use the same style to display their products.
                    All of the pro models use dark colors and their regular models use the lighter colors.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Alignment: Different sections of the page have their concise alignmnet.
                    By using elements on both sides of the page it creates a cohesive manner.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Proximity: All of the elements on the page are grouped togther in way so that you can access more information on certain
                    products. The proximity of the pro models and the base models are well placed. You can always click the learn more button 
                    on each of the products.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>
                <a class="h3-link" target="_blank" href="https://arngren.net">Arngren Website </a>
            </h3>
            <p>This is a Norwegian website that sells motorized vechicals and bikes.</p>
            <p>From ATVs to childrens goKarts to bicycles to mopads, this website sells it all.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Contrast: Elements on the page tend to contrast each other.
                    The use of multiple images scattered everywhere can be visually stimulating.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Repetition: The use of multiple images with different sizes makes it hard to understand
                    what type of product it is and where you could get more of those similar products.
                    Links tend to either go to an about section or another external website. It is very confusing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Alignment: Most of the acutal products tend to be scattered between the middle of the website.
                    The nav bar on the left makes it easier for you to see what type of product you are looking for but is still could use better 
                    alignmnet all around.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Proximity: None of the elements seemed to be grouped togther. The links to the about section
                    does provide some principles of the proximity in the CRAP design principle. The link is available right on top of the product.
                </li>
            </ul>
