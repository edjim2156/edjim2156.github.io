        Hi, I'm Pilar, the owner of Pilar's Golf Shop. What started as a fun hobby of playing golf and growing my own collection has slowly grown into a small business. 
        I've lived and played on the southern east coast for 20+ years. 
        I offer carefully selected, pre-owned golf clubs and balls that are affordable and of great quality. 
        Whether you're a pro or a starter, I'm here to help you find the right gear.
        Thanks for all the support, come by and see us this weekend! 
      </p>
