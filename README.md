# Personal Website Project  

This project was created as part of **ITIS 3135 – Web-Based Application Design and Development** at UNC Charlotte. I built a multi-page personal website from scratch using my university’s web hosting service. The project demonstrates different web development techniques, responsive design, and front-end concepts.  

## Highlights  
- **Responsive Design** – Pages adapt for desktop and mobile viewing.  
- **Slideshows & Image Gallery** – Interactive displays built with JavaScript.  
- **HTML Tables** – Practiced structured, semantic markup.  
- **Personal Hobby Site** – A creative page to showcase interests.  
- **"Build Your Own Intro" Page** – Users upload a picture and enter text, with results generated dynamically using the DOM and template literals.  

## Technologies  
- **HTML5**  
- **CSS3** (styling, layout, responsive design)  
- **JavaScript** (DOM manipulation, template literals, event handling)  

## Purpose  
This course project highlights my ability to design, develop, and deploy a multi-page website. It showcases my skills in:  
- Front-end development  
- Responsive web design  
- Problem-solving and interactivity
